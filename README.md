# 🍴 Cuisine Prediction Based on Ingredients

In this project, we aim to predict the **cuisine type** based on the list of ingredients in recipes. Using data from [Kaggle's What's Cooking Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/whats-cooking/overview), we'll dive deep into the flavors of the world through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualizations. 🌍🍲

Our process is simple yet effective:
1. **Visualize** the dataset to understand ingredient patterns and trends across cuisines. 🧑‍🍳🔍
2. Apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess and transform ingredient data for machine learning. ✨📊
3. Build and evaluate **XGBClassifier** model, leveraging their predictive power to classify cuisines with precision. 🚀🤖
